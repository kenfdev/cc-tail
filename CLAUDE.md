## Feature Progress Tracking

After implementing, modifying, or reviewing any feature, update `docs/feature-progress.md` to reflect the current state. This includes:

- Marking phases (Plan/Implement/Review) as `[x]` done, `[~]` in progress, or `[ ]` not started
- Updating the Notes column with source files, line counts, test counts, and implementation details
- Keeping the Summary table at the bottom in sync with the per-feature sections
